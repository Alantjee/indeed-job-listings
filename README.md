Indeed Job skills comparison

## Motivation
The job market is becoming ever more competitive, as a student nowadays it is harder and harder to land the job of your dreams. Corona has even made it more challenging for recent graduates to find a fitting role after graduation. A lot of students complain about the gap between skills learned during their studies and the actual skills required in the workfield by companies. This motivates our investigation into indeed job vacancy postings to find the skills that are actually required for different job types. As Marketing Analytics students, we have both the marketing and analytical knowledge to succeed in a range of different job types int he field of marketing. We are interested in what the actual required skills are for jobs in fields related to our studies. Becoming a data scientist, analist or maybe marketeer after our studies will require different skills and competencies and we would like to know to which degree we possess the skills and to which extent our study program effectively prepares us for the job market. We aspire to find insights to help ourselves and our fellow students in making a choice which skills to improve and perhaps which skills to forego in order to effecitvely land their first job. We aim to conduct  our investigation in such a way that the methodology can be used by anyone for any location in the world and for any job type.
