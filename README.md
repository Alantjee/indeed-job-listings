# oDCMscraper

This repository contains the entire workflow for our ODCM and DPREP group project. For our project we scraped indeed.com for marketing analist and Data scientist job description in the Netherlands.

We hope  our fellow students in the Master Marketing Analytics or related programs across the country find insights into the path to first job after graduation from our project.
