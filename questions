1. We now include only the folders in the dataprep makefile, is that good enough?
In the older version we included all separate datasets (68 files), but with the batch numbers it would never be repreducable with another search term.
However, with another search term, all our code files have to be adjusted as well.

2. Is it okay if we work with the little makefiles? We now have one in dataprep, one in analysis, and one in the general workflow that runs the two others.
Or do we need to have one big makefile in the workflow.

3. What is exactly meant by instances in the datasheet documentation file? We now interpreted it as entities.
