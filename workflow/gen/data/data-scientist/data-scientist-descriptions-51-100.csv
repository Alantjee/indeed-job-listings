8fb5ec0877e47e09,"Mendix is on a mission to enable anyone in any organization – from the marketing coordinator to the software developer to the CEO – to create things that are transformational for their company. We are fundamentally reinventing the way applications are created and we’re reinventing the future of software development. Sounds ambitious, right? We agree.  Not to brag, but nearly 4,000 organizations worldwide, including KLM, Medtronic, Merck, and Philips, rely on Mendix to build web and mobile applications. Thousands of our customers use our platform to delight their clients and empower their employees. It’s no surprise that we’re a recognized Leader by Gartner and Forrester in a red-hot market expected to exceed $21 billion by 2022. Ok, maybe we did want to brag a little. But we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished…and…we’re humble enough to admit that we need you to make us even more effective.  Are you the experienced Data Quality Manager to help create Mendix’s analytics center of excellence? Do you have a good view on what an analytics center of excellence within a pioneering tech company should look like? Then we are looking for you.  What is our analytics center of excellence (CoE)? Mendix has doubled in size in only a year and a half. As such, the need for analytics insights and automation are becoming increasingly important. The analytics center of excellence will be providing different business units with dedicated partners that create new analytics products and insights to improve the performance of their units and make the right decisions. The COE is supported by a technical data engineering team who are responsible for the Mendix’s data landscape (datalake & data warehouse). The CoE is still relatively small and currently consists of 4 analysts, 2 data engineers, and a data scientist. However analytics has been recognized as an incredibly important area of investment by Mendix’s management. Therefor we will be hiring several new members in the CoE this year and hope to more than double the size of the team by the end of the year.  What job would you be applying for? You should expect to become the ‘go-to’ person for data. Any person in the organization that has a question about data will probably end up with you and you need to be able to assist them or steer them in the right direction. We expect that you will establish data governance processes and frameworks in the organization that will truly empower the business to use data, instead of having conversations on whether this is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ data. We are looking for someone that can partner up with the business. Mendix is a young and dynamic organization that does not have many established business processes or governance frameworks in place. It will be your challenge to help the business see the value of establishing these governance frameworks and to create them. Mentoring people in the business as well as younger members of our CoE is an important part of your role. We are looking for people with new ideas and several years of experience that can help enrich the CoE and raise it to the next level. Overview of activities: Establishing governance frameworks within Mendix that introduces data ownership within each business unit (responsibility and accountability); Establishing governance frameworks and processes around data creation, processing, and reporting within each business unit; Coordinating with stakeholders to gather, map, and document meta data from each business unit (master data management); Coordinating with stakeholders to create a clear overview of data flows between systems and data used in reporting; Setting standards for data quality and data accuracy for products created by the analytics CoE; Monitor and improve data quality and being able to identify and improve the reliability of the data; Being a key consulting stakeholder when the business has questions related to the internal data landscape; Identifying risks and solutions for projects where the internal data landscape is involved; Planning and creating the internal data landscape roadmap and strategy. About you: You are a senior data professional that can help shape our new center of excellence. Our team of analysts is relatively young. Our organization is also new to data driven decision making. We are therefore looking for people that can bring industry best practices into the CoE and have several years of experience working in an agile work environment. If you have several years of experience in a variety of data related roles and you are eager to bring your experience in a young, thriving, and quickly scaling organization, then you are the person we are looking for! Technical requirements: 5+ years’ proven experience and excellent understanding of data administration, (master)data management functions (collection, analysis, distribution etc.), regulatory aspects (GDPR, HIPAA) and experience with FAIR, data governance and data stewardship principles; Experience with data processing languages or scripting languages such as: SQL, R or Python. Business requirements: You are a hands-on person with a “can do” mentality and you are not afraid to set up collaborations, make decisions, set priorities and put them into action in a dynamic environment; You are a critical thinker that is not afraid to challenge the business and move the organization to a new maturity level in data driven decision making; Experience with quickly learning about and familiarizing yourself with different business domains; Experience as a trusted advisor for data related questions or inquiries (the “go-to data person”); Experience with working in an agile scrum environment; Experience with mentoring and/or teaching subject matter to colleagues; Able to speak fluent English; Speaking Dutch is a plus. Personal character traits: A good understanding of business needs and the ability to act accordingly, taking measured risks into account and the ability to take the organization to a next maturity level. The ability to remain fully functional by adapting to changing circumstances (environment, procedures, people). Absorb new information readily and to put it into practice effectively. Assertiveness; the ability to bring one’s views across clearly without damaging the relationship with stakeholders. Creativity; the ability to come up with original and innovative ideas and solutions, to adopt points of view outside the usual parameters. The ability to ask further with the ambition to deeply understand other perspectives and views in order to generate support.  If you don’t comply with the following criteria please do not respond to this job offer: All technical requirements; Experienced as a trusted advisor for data related questions or inquiries; Experienced in challenging the business and moving the organization to a new maturity level in data driven decision making.

Hoe kunnen we ervoor zorgen dat we het beste rendement op iedere geïnvesteerde euro in de zorg realiseren? Wij hebben hiervoor het ‘Doelmatig Direct Declareren Partnership’ (DDD-Partnership)-model ontwikkeld, waarmee zorgverleners die bewezen zinnige zorg leveren worden beloond. Het vertrouwen tussen verzekeraar en zorgverlener wordt hiermee vergroot, de administratieve lasten nemen af en de zorggelden worden aantoonbaar zinnig besteed. Met ruim 30 collega’s werken wij samen met ziekenhuizen, apotheken en GGZ-instellingen aan zinnige zorg. Deze zorgaanbieders realiseren hiermee voor hen voordelen als betere inkoopvoorwaarden, minder administratieve lasten, verbetering van interne processen en een (nog) beter maatschappelijk imago. Dagelijks is i2i in gesprek met medisch specialisten gericht op het realiseren van een gedragsverandering in kosteneffectiviteit en kwaliteit van geleverde zorg.
