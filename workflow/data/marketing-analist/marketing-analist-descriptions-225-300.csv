090ea71f38a739d4,"Mendix is on a mission to enable anyone in any organization – from the marketing coordinator to the software developer to the CEO – to create things that are transformational for their company. We are fundamentally reinventing the way applications are created and we’re reinventing the future of software development. Sounds ambitious, right? We agree.  Not to brag, but nearly 4,000 organizations worldwide, including KLM, Medtronic, Merck, and Philips, rely on Mendix to build web and mobile applications. Thousands of our customers use our platform to delight their clients and empower their employees. It’s no surprise that we’re a recognized Leader by Gartner and Forrester in a red-hot market expected to exceed $21 billion by 2022. Ok, maybe we did want to brag a little. But we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished…and…we’re humble enough to admit that we need you to make us even more effective.  Are you the experienced Medior Data Analyst to help create Mendix’s analytics center of excellence? Do you have a good view on what an analytics center of excellence within a pioneering tech company should look like? Then we are looking for you.  What is our analytics center of excellence (COE)?  Mendix has doubled in size in only a year and a half. As such, the need for analytics insights and automation are becoming increasingly important. The analytics center of excellence will be providing different business units with dedicated partners that create new analytics products and insights to improve the performance of their units and make the rights decisions.  The COE is supported by a technical data engineering team who are responsible for the Mendix’s data landscape (think datalake & data warehouse). The COE is still relatively small and currently consists of 4 analysts, however analytics has been recognized as an incredibly important area of investment by Mendix’s management. Therefor we will be hiring several new analysts in the COE this year and hope to more than double the size of the team by the end of the year.  What job would you be applying for?  The role of a Medior Data Analyst varies quite a bit per organization. In our case, we’re looking for people that can partner up with the business and come up with solutions and insights that will help them make better decisions and become more efficient. As a data analyst in the COE you will be dedicated to a specific business unit. You will also support another analyst as a backup for a second business unit. You will work closely together with that unit to learn the domain knowledge necessary to help create useful analytics solutions together with them.  Mentoring other members of the COE and helping build the foundation of our COE best practices will also be an important part of your role. We are looking for people with new ideas and several years of analytics experience that can help enrich the COE.  About you:  You are a Medior Data Analyst that can help shape our new center of excellence. Our team of analysts is relatively young, therefore we are looking for people that can bring industry best practices into the COE and have several years of experience working in an agile work environment. If you have several years of experience in a data analytics related role and you are eager to bring your experience in a young, thriving, and quickly scaling organization, then you are the person we are looking for!

Technical requirements: KPI creation, target setting, forecasting, operationalization; Data processing languages or scripting languages such as: SQL, R or Python; BI tooling such as Power BI, Tableau, QlikSense or BI dashboard creation using languages such as Python or Shiny Research and hypothesis design; Creating, implementing, releasing, and enabling the business in using analytics products such as: automated health score or priority systems, account based marketing, smart chat bots, automated notifications triggered by changes in metrics, forecasting models, prediction models, clustering systems, or other analytics related techniques or products;  Business requirements: Experience with low code (app) development; Experience (5+ years) with presenting analytics solutions or actionable insights from research to management; Experience presenting analytics solutions or actionable insights from research to high level executives; Experience with working in an agile scrum environment; Experience with gathering requirements from the business; Experience with challenging business partners to uncover the right requirements and clearly scope requests or ideas; Experience with quickly learning about and familiarizing yourself with different business domains; Experience with stakeholder management between different business units and management levels; Experience with mentoring and/or teaching subject matter to colleagues; Able to speak fluent English; Speaking Dutch is a plus. Personal character traits: A good understanding of business needs and the ability to act accordingly, taking measured risks into account and the ability to take the organization to a next maturity level; The ability to remain fully functional by adapting to changing circumstances (environment, procedures, people). Absorb new information readily and to put it into practice effectively; Assertiveness; the ability to bring one’s views across clearly without damaging the relationship with stakeholders; Creativity; the ability to come up with original and innovative ideas and solutions, to adopt points of view outside the usual parameters; The ability to ask further with the ambition to deeply understand other perspectives and views in order to generate support. Our Guiding Principles  While we live on different continents, speak different languages, and work on different things, we are bound by our “MendixBlue” guiding principles. Being “MendixBlue” means that you live the culture, and you consistently improve it as we grow. It’s kind of a big deal.  We put the customer first. Without our customers, we have no business.

We nurture talent. We look, not just at the sum of what an individual has done, but at the potential of who they can be. So, if you’re up for learning from your failures…you belong here.

On a daily basis, we find unique brands and use machine learning to connect them with the right retailers. We take the guesswork out of the equation by unlocking the power of data for all.
