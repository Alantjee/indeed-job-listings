De grootste uitdaging Chatbot Billie krijgt een steeds menselijker gezicht. Dat leidt niet alleen tot een toename van het aantal klantgesprekken (nu zo’n 7 miljoen per jaar) maar betaalt zich ook uit in stijgende klanttevredenheid.

a0c1b6a49ab5258f,"PhD: Effect of inflow conditions on the source noise of large onshore wind turbines Apply Now Job description The noise of modern large wind turbines is dominated by trailing edge noise from the blades. Several noise reduction technologies, like serrations, have been successfully applied in the industry to reduce this noise source. However, the influence of inflow parameters on wind turbine noise, including the dependence on terrain and meteorological conditions, is largely unknown. The purpose of this PhD project is to understand the influence of inflow conditions on airfoil source noise, quantify the importance on large wind turbines, and explore noise reduction technologies. This PhD project is supervised by both TU Delft and by the wind turbine manufacturer Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE). The candidate will be spending most of the time at TU Delft but may also work for shorter periods at SGRE in Denmark. The candidate will cooperate with supervisors at TU Delft and SGRE to carry out the following research goals: Understanding of inflow turbulence noise on 2D airfoils by combined numerical and experimental work. Computational aeroacoustics and analytical theories will be applied, and acoustic/aerodynamic wind tunnel experiments will be carried out, trying to mimic full-scale wind turbine conditions. Understanding of the dependencies and characteristics of inflow turbulence noise will be a priority. Parameters to be studied include for example inflow turbulence characteristics, flow speed, angle of attack, and airfoil shape. Based on these studies mitigation technologies to reduce inflow turbulence noise on 2D airfoils will be explored. Transfer the findings for the 2D airfoil case to full scale wind turbines using computational aeroacoustics and semi empirical modelling. The effect of inflow turbulence levels and other inflow parameters (shear, density, etc.) on wind turbine noise will be carried out, using existing full scale experimental data. Noise mitigation technologies will be assessed in terms of acoustic/aerodynamic benefit, implementation, cost, etc. Requirements The PhD position is granted by the Marie Skłodowska Curie ETN Zephyr project. Mobility requirements apply to this position. Researchers can be of any nationality.

5cec3719d99478b0,"We are looking for a PhD student who will work on the topic of “Targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress to prevent diabetes-induced atrial fibrillation.” The project: Atrial fibrillation is the most common progressive arrhythmia of the heart, which is associated with increased mortality, serious complications, high hospitalization rate and poses a high socioeconomic burden. Diabetes is a strong and independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Around 15% of diabetic patients develop atrial fibrillation, for which so far no effective curative therapy exists. It is therefore very important to understand the mechanism that drives atrial fibrillation in diabetes to design preventative measures for diabetes-induced atrial fibrillation. Our preliminary evidence suggests that mitochondrial oxidative stress causes diabetes-induced atrial fibrillation and represents a novel prevention target. In this project, our aim is to define mitochondrial oxidative stress as a causal factor for diabetes-induced atrial fibrillation and to prove mitochondrial oxidative stress is a causal pathway and novel therapeutic target to prevent onset of atrial fibrillation and progression in diabetic patients. To this end, we have developed various cutting-edge imaging techniques, including high-speed imaging of calcium and mitochondrial oxidative stress. We will use various (genetic) probes to accurately measure calcium fluxes and mitochondrial oxidative stress and electrophysiological parameters. This unique and innovative combination of techniques makes it possible to firmly establish the conceivable causal role of Mitochondrial oxidative stress in arrhythmogenesis and to dissect the mechanistic pathway involved. Moreover, we will use various model systems from cells, Drosophila (which we established previously) and mouse (a unique model developed in our lab) to human atrial materials. This will provide novel insights in atrial fibrillation and solid data with high translational potential. Your main task: 1) to screen novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in preventing arrhythmogenesis in diabetes in experimental model systems for atrial fibrillation; 2) to study whether mitochondrial oxidative stress play a causal role in arrhythmogenesis responsible for diabetes-induced atrial fibrillation development.  You will be supported by experts from human and animal physiology at Wageningen University but also experts from industry and other universities, as this project is a research project involving collaboration with a company and a couple of groups from other universities. We propose a holistic approach from cells to human using various cutting edge techniques. You should therefore be motivated to learn and combine research from different disciplines.

bf3b78b2464a6bad,"Graduation: Knowledge Graphs for Improving Robot Operations in Logistics  Assignment type: Graduation Assignment duration: ASAP, for six months Location: Veghel and home office Educational: WO Desired study: Data Science, Computer Science or related studies Language: English  Description of the assignment Vanderlande offers automated warehouse solutions to their customers. Part of these solutions are industrial robot arms that can stack and de-stack products. One type of robot arms can remove products of the same type from a pallet sent by a supplier, called “depalletizing”. Think of a pallet full of stacked boxes of pasta bags that all have to be removed to be distributed further one by one. The other type of robots carefully stacks products of different sizes, weight and stability into roll cages, called “palletizing”. Think of stacking beverages, pasta, chocolate, flour, toilet paper etc. to be delivered to a single supermarket. A planning program gives the robot the ideal placement of all products in the roll cage (heavy products at the bottom, lighter products at the top, place products only on the stable edges of other boxes underneath etc.). Both types of robots are operating with various sensors and internal models to pick up products and place them on the conveyor belt or in the roll cage. As in any automated system, sensors may not be fully reliable, and models may not capture all aspects of the movement and placement of products. This can lead to products being not placed correctly on the conveyor belt or in the roll cage. In the latter case, incorrect placement of products can lead to a blockage of the robot arm during a next placement, or an instable stack that can in the worst-case collapse during further handling. Vanderlande is collecting extensive data about the movement of the robot arm, the placement and position of products and all desired and undesired events in this palletizing and depalletizing process. The long-term objective of Vanderlande is to create an improved model of product placement on conveyor belts and in roll cages together with an improved model of the robot arm that can inform the development of better control model for the robot. This project takes a first step in developing a reliable data-driven model of the process of palletizing products from the available data, that is, how products are actually being placed and stacked in roll cages. The first objective is to develop a knowledge-graph describing the physical positioning of products on the stack in the roll cage. The graph shall describe products, their relative and absolute position, augmented with sensor information about (in-)correct placement, and event information about robot movement and when and how products are being placed. Altogether, this graph shall describe the process of building a stack in time and space in a single data model. The second objective is to explore reasoning on this knowledge graph through querying and graph mining: How does the stack built from sensor and event information compare to the ideal stack given by the planning program? By comparing different stacks built for different product combinations, are there typical deviations or mistakes in stacking that cause undesired events in the stacking? Can the causes be detected as the stack is being built before undesired events occur? The final objective is to outline data requirements to make the same knowledge-graph based approach also applicable to the de-palletizing step (as currently less data is available for this step). The expected outcomes of this project are: A proof-of-concept data model for a knowledge graph of the process of building a product stack by a robot arm that addresses the above properties; A proof-of-concept implementation of a data integration and processing pipeline to construct such knowledge graphs from available data sources within Vanderlande; An evaluation of which properties of the process of building a product stack can be answered reliably on the knowledge graph using process mining and graph mining, for example which (combinations of) product properties lead to undesired events in the palletizing process. Department description The Systems Engineering group is part of the Strategy & Markets department, which provides a strategy for our Warehousing Solutions business based on market trends and insights. In line with this strategy, the Systems Engineers drive the development of new concepts & solutions and improvements of existing solutions. Next to this, they support Sales, Operations and Service in correctly deploying our products in customer system designs. For this internship, the student will be working on ideas to further improve an existing concept, in close cooperation with the responsible Systems Engineers and some experts from the Data Service Development & Data Science team. Data Service Development & Data Science team within the Global Services organization is responsible for the further digitalization of Life-cycle Services. The team is working on fundamental descriptive and diagnostic solutions and challenging use cases such as models that predict operational behaviour of the logistics systems or failure of physical system components. This is a growing, autonomous team of data scientists, data engineers and data architects that is driving the digitalization of Vanderlande life-cycle services. In our team experiments and entrepreneurial spirit are highly valued Your responsibilities A proof-of-concept data model for a knowledge graph of the process of building a product stack by a robot arm that addresses the above properties; A proof-of-concept implementation of a data integration and processing pipeline to construct such knowledge graphs from available data sources within Vanderlande; An evaluation of which properties of the process of building a product stack can be answered reliably on the knowledge graph using process mining and graph mining, for example which (combinations of) product properties lead to undesired events in the palletizing process.
