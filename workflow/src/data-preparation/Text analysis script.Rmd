## R Markdown text analysis script
In this script we will analyze the text data from the job descriptions from our scraper. The data we scraped fromt the indeed website contains a text for each job with a description of the job, job tasks and required qualifications etc. We want to analyze the frequency of certain job skills such as programming languages, database knowledge and other technical knowledge. 

First we will install and then load the required packages for text analysis
```{r}
install.packages("tidytext", "readtext")
library(tidytext)
library(readtext)
```



```{r}

```
