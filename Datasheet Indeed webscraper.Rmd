## **1. Motivation**

#### *1.1 For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*

Indeed is a worldwide employment website for job listings. Currently, Indeed is the market-leader within the Dutch labor market. Data analyst is currently a high in demand job. The purpose for collecting this data is to gather insights into which skills are the most commonly required for such a position. The dataset aims to enable answering the research question in terms of what are the key skills required for a 'Data Analist' job in the Netherlands? In answering this question, the researchers can for instance spot trends when it comes to which programming languages are more popular and which are decreasing in demand, as well as provide a guideline for young professionals seeking a data analyst position as a future job.

#### *1.2 Who created this dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?*

This dataset has been created by Anouk Heemskerk, Georgiana Huţanu, Renée Nieuwkoop and Alan Rijnders at Tilburg University.

####  *1.3 Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*

The deployment of this project has no associated grant.

##  **2. Composition**

####  *2.1 What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*

Each instance consists of a 'Data Analist' job posting in the Netherlands.

#### *2.2 How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?* 

The dataset contains .... job postings in total (Number of jobs we were able to scrape in the definitive dataset)

#### *2.3 Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*

The dataset contains all the the possible instances available on Indeed.com with the search term for 'Wat': 'Data Analist', and for 'Waar': 'Nederland'.

#### *2.4 What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a de-scription.*

Each instance consists of the full job description (only textual information) that is listed on Indeed.com.

#### *2.5 Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*

\-

#### *2.6 Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.*

(Only doable if we actually have the data) Missing: Star ratings? Salary in some of them.

#### *2.7 Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*

\-

#### *2.8 Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*

\-

#### *2.9 Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they ex- isted at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*

\-

#### *2.10 Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctorpatient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*

No. All the data within the set derived from a publicly available website and does not contain personal and/or confidential data.

#### *2.11 Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*

No. The dataset only consists of textual information within job descriptions.

#### *2.12 Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.*

No. The dataset does not relate to individual people.

#### *2.13 Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*

\-

#### *2.14 Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*

\-

#### *2.15 Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*

## **3. Collection process**

#### *3.1 How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by sub- jects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*

The data within the set was directly observable as raw text.
